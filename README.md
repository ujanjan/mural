# Mural

**The language app you eventually delete.**

> **Fork note:** this fork ([ujanjan/mural](https://github.com/ujanjan/mural)) adds a **macOS app target** and a **Swedish (Svenska) language module** on top of upstream [Chuloo/mural](https://github.com/Chuloo/mural). See [Run on a Mac](#run-on-a-mac) and the Swedish notes under [What works today](#what-works-today).

Mural is a native iPhone app for learning through conversation. Speak to a warm, animated orb, follow the meaning when you need it, and practise words again in later conversations. Mural adjusts the challenge from the evidence in your replies.

Built with SwiftUI, Liquid Glass and local SwiftData storage. This version connects directly to OpenAI using your own API key. It needs an internet connection, but no Mural account or running Mac.

## Get started

You need a Mac with Xcode 26 or later, an iPhone running iOS 26.1 or later, an Apple Account, and an OpenAI API project with billing and access to GPT-Live-1 and GPT-5.6 Luna. A ChatGPT subscription does not provide API credit.

### Install with a local AI agent

If Codex or another coding agent has access to your Mac's files and terminal, paste the prompt below. The agent can clone, build and install Mural. You handle Apple Account sign-in and team selection in Xcode, device trust and Developer Mode prompts, and API-key entry inside the app. The [iPhone installation guide](docs/run-on-iphone.md) covers each step.

```text
Help me build and install Mural on my iPhone from https://github.com/Chuloo/mural.

Clone the repository into a new local folder, or use this checkout if it is
already open. Read README.md, docs/run-on-iphone.md and docs/build-and-test.md.
Check that Xcode and its iOS tools are ready, resolve the pinned dependencies,
run the offline core tests, and build the iOS Simulator target.

Guide me through adding my Apple Account and choosing my signing team in
Xcode. For a first installation, help me choose a unique bundle identifier if
needed. Preserve the existing team and identifier when updating Mural, and
do not uninstall it or erase its learning data.

Detect my connected iPhone, build with the configured signing team, install
Mural and launch it. Tell me when I need to unlock the phone, trust this Mac
or the developer profile, enable Developer Mode, or approve a system prompt.

I will choose my learning and subtitle languages, then enter my own OpenAI
API key in Settings > Advanced > Use your own API key. Do not ask me to paste
the key into chat, read it from Keychain, or put it in source files or logs.
Leave managed accounts, hosted trials and purchases disabled.

Finish by reporting which build and installation checks passed, and anything
I still need to do on the phone. I will start the first live conversation.
```

### Install with Xcode

1. Clone [Chuloo/mural](https://github.com/Chuloo/mural), or download its ZIP. Open `Mural.xcodeproj` from the directory containing this README.
2. In Xcode, open **Settings → Accounts** and add your Apple Account.
3. Select the **Mural** target, open **Signing & Capabilities**, enable automatic signing, and choose your team. For your own fork, replace the bundle identifier with a unique value such as `com.yourname.mural`. Keep that value stable for later updates.
4. Connect and unlock your iPhone. Trust the Mac if prompted. Turn on **Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer Mode** on the phone, restart, and confirm the setting.
5. Select **Mural** as the scheme and your iPhone as the destination, then click **Run**. If iOS asks you to trust the developer, do so in **Settings → General → VPN & Device Management**.
6. Choose your learning and subtitle languages in the welcome screens. In **Settings → Advanced → Use your own API key**, save your own OpenAI project key. Start a conversation and allow microphone access.

You should hear Mural greet you in your chosen language. You can now disconnect your phone from the Mac and use Wi-Fi or cellular.

### Run on a Mac

This fork adds a **MuralMac** target that builds the same SwiftUI app for macOS. Voice conversation, meaning subtitles, word lookup, themes and local learning storage work the same way; the debug audio-verification tool remains iPhone-only. The Mac app uses the iOS layout in a resizable window rather than a redesigned desktop interface.

You need a Mac running **macOS 26 or later** (an M1 MacBook Air works), **Xcode 26 or later**, an Apple Account, and an OpenAI API project key as described above.

1. Open `Mural.xcodeproj`, select the **MuralMac** scheme and **My Mac** as the destination.
2. Select the **MuralMac** target, open **Signing & Capabilities**, enable automatic signing and choose your team. A free Personal Team works. If `no.william.mural.mac` is already taken, replace the bundle identifier with a unique value. `Config/Local.xcconfig` configures the team for both targets.
3. Click **Run**. macOS asks for microphone access when you start a conversation; you can change it later in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone**.
4. Choose **Svenska** in the welcome screens (or later in **Settings → Learning language → Swedish · Sweden**). Save your OpenAI key in **Settings → Advanced → Use your own API key**, then start a conversation.

From the terminal:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Mural.xcodeproj -scheme MuralMac \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' \
  -derivedDataPath .build/DerivedData \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

The Mac build shares `Core/` with the iPhone app, so `swift test` covers both.

A free Personal Team can run the app on your own phone; TestFlight and App Store distribution require Apple Developer Program membership. Free provisioning profiles expire after seven days. Refresh by running the same project again, preserving the team and bundle identifier. Export a learning backup before changing either or switching phones. See the [detailed iPhone guide](docs/run-on-iphone.md) for common setup problems. [Apple membership guidance](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/)

## What works today

- **A warm welcome:** choose a learning language and a subtitle language in two short screens, with a greeting that changes languages.
- **Conversation practice:** live voice, gentle corrections, optional meaning subtitles, word lookup, mute, and a typed reply when speaking is inconvenient.
- **Themes:** 24 conversation settings, with cultural details supplied by each language module. You can also request a current topic; web search supplies source links.
- **Adaptive practice:** vocabulary and provisional ability observations come from validated conversation evidence. Each learning language keeps separate progress.
- **Recall bars:** one to three bars summarise repeated retrieval over time. Three bars require spaced evidence in different contexts. These are product heuristics, not calibrated forgetting probabilities or a language certificate.
- **A fresh start:** the Talk screen returns to its greeting 15 seconds after a conversation ends. Tap **New conversation** to reset immediately. Your saved conversations and learning remain.
- **Local records:** export or import a JSON learning backup, delete a conversation, or delete all learning data from Settings.

The modules teach Norwegian Bokmål with an Eastern Norwegian voice target, Spanish from Spain, international English, French from France, and — in this fork — standard Swedish (rikssvenska) with fika, sommarstuga and lagom cultural themes. Voice accent and teaching guidance are model instructions; fluent-speaker review is still needed before making pronunciation or learning-effectiveness claims.

## Privacy and API costs

Mural stores conversations, vocabulary and preferences on your device. The iPhone app has no Mural cloud sync, analytics SDK, advertising or account connection in this version. Your API key is stored in the device’s Keychain, excluded from learning exports, and sent only to OpenAI.

During practice, audio, selected conversation text, learning context and requested searches go to OpenAI. Mural does not save raw audio. API requests set `store: false` where supported, but that does not disable all provider retention; OpenAI’s abuse-monitoring rules and your project’s settings still apply. [OpenAI data controls](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/your-data)

OpenAI bills your project for voice, text and search. The app’s usage display is an estimate, and its conversation time limit is not a billing cap. Check your OpenAI project’s usage and spending settings.

## Planned public service

Managed free minutes, accounts and credit purchases are **not available in the iPhone app or a live Mural service**. The [backend foundation](server/README.md) contains account verification, a credit ledger and sandbox payment support. Its runbook lists the remaining work before commercial activation. No shared provider key belongs in this repository or a distributed app binary.

A public TestFlight link and App Store listing are not yet available. [Release preparation](release/README.md) records the outstanding requirements.

The [Mural website](https://mural.chat) lives in the separate [Chuloo/mural-website repository](https://github.com/Chuloo/mural-website).

## Build and test

From the directory containing `Package.swift`:

```sh
swift test
xcodebuild -project Mural.xcodeproj -scheme Mural \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
  -derivedDataPath .build/DerivedData \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO ARCHS=arm64 ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES build
```

For UI tests, create or select an iPhone 17 simulator in Xcode, then run **Product → Test**. The tests use in-memory fixtures and do not require an API key. More commands and preview options are in [the build guide](docs/build-and-test.md).

On 12 September 2026, the English, French, onboarding and AI-consent build passed **41 core tests and 11 native UI tests**. This covers language-specific progress, the two welcome screens, consent for existing users, secure key entry and the conversation controls. Earlier iPhone checks verified Spanish speech, Meaning during and after a conversation, reset, retained history and audio cleanup; those live results apply to the earlier tested builds.
